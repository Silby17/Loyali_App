# Loyali_App
CS Final Project Android App

Welcome to the Loyali_App wiki!

Loyali was my final project of my BSc. Computer Science degree in Bar-Ilan University, Israel.

Loyali is a mobile app that take all the classic "Buy 10 get 1 free" punch cards out of you wallet and into one app in the palm of your hand.

The user is able to see their current status, gain rewards and most importantly saves the user from having their wallet stuffed with old cardboard cards for all the establishments they frequent.
